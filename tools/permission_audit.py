"""permission_audit.py; make the permission catalogue authoritative.

Apache Fineract keeps 960 permission rows in a table, and a hand-maintained
catalogue drifts from the code. This audit is what keeps ours from drifting. It
reads the *built* Candid interface of Bank.mo and the catalogue in
src/bank/Permissions.mo and fails on any of:

  1. a public update method of the service that is neither guarded by a
     catalogue entry nor listed as deliberately open, with a reason;
  2. a `Command` variant with no permission entry;
  3. a catalogue entry naming a method or a command that does not exist;
  4. a duplicate permission identifier;
  5. a money-moving permission that is not dual-by-default.

Exit code 0 and a printed count on success; non-zero with the offending names on
failure. Counts are printed either way, because a tool that examined zero
methods has failed its coverage requirement.

Usage: permission_audit.py <bank.did> [<Permissions.mo>]
